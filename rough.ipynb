      "Expert Analysis:\n",
      "Based on the provided information and SQL queries, here is my analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Occupancy Rates and ADRs:\n",
      "The database does not seem to contain tables related to bookings or property details, which are required to calculate occupancy rates and average daily rates (ADRs) for each property over time. Without access to data on room bookings, check-in/check-out dates, number of available rooms, and rates, it is not possible to derive these metrics accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Correlation between Occupancy and ADR:\n",
      "The query attempts to calculate the correlation coefficient between occupancy rates and ADRs for each property in 2024. It does this by first unpivoting the data, calculating mean occupancy and ADR per property, and then applying the correlation formula. However, the CORR function is not available in this database, so the query uses a manual calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where:\n",
      "- 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation (as occupancy increases, ADR increases)\n",
      "- -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation (as occupancy increases, ADR decreases)\n",
      "- 0 indicates no correlation between occupancy and ADR\n",
      "\n",
      "This analysis can help identify properties where occupancy and ADR move together strongly (high positive correlation) versus properties where they may move in opposite directions (negative correlation).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. RevPAR Calculation:\n",
      "The database lacks the necessary room revenue and available room details at the property level to accurately calculate RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room). While the FINAL_INCOME_SHEET_NEW_SEQ table contains revenue information, it does not specify room revenue or available rooms. Without this granular data, calculating the true RevPAR metric is not possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Budgeted RevPAR Targets:\n",
      "The FINAL_BUDGET_SHEET table contains budgeted RevPAR targets for each property, with separate columns for each month and a total column. This data can be queried to retrieve the budgeted monthly and annual RevPAR goals for different properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Actual vs. Budgeted RevPAR Comparison:\n",
      "To compare actual RevPAR performance against budgeted targets, the query joins the FINAL_BUDGET_SHEET (budgeted data) and FINAL_INCOME_SHEET_NEW_SEQ (actual data) tables. It filters for the 'TOTAL REV PAR' account name and a specific month (January 2024 in the example). By comparing the Budget_January and Actual_January columns, you can assess if the actual RevPAR met, exceeded, or fell short of the budgeted target for that month and property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional Information Needed:\n",
      "- To calculate occupancy rates and ADRs, access to booking data (check-in/check-out dates, number of rooms booked, rates) and property details (number of available rooms) would be required.\n",
      "- To calculate true RevPAR, room revenue and available room data at the property level would be needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while the database contains some financial data and budgeted targets, it lacks the specific operational details required to accurately calculate key performance metrics like occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR at the property level. Enhancing the database schema or integrating additional data sources would be necessary to enable these analyses.\n",

      "By executing these queries, you can analyze the correlation between occupancy rates and ADRs for each property, calculate the RevPAR, retrieve the budgeted RevPAR targets, and compare the actual RevPA\n",
      "Analysis:\n",
      "Based on the provided information and SQL queries, here is my analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Occupancy Rates and ADRs:\n",
      "The database does not seem to contain tables related to bookings or property details, which are required to calculate occupancy rates and average daily rates (ADRs) for each property over time. Without access to data on room bookings, check-in/check-out dates, number of available rooms, and rates, it is not possible to derive these metrics accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Correlation between Occupancy and ADR:\n",
      "The query attempts to calculate the correlation coefficient between occupancy rates and ADRs for each property in 2024. It does this by first unpivoting the data, calculating mean occupancy and ADR per property, and then applying the correlation formula. However, the CORR function is not available in this database, so the query uses a manual calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where:\n",
      "- 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation (as occupancy increases, ADR increases)\n",
      "- -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation (as occupancy increases, ADR decreases)\n",
      "- 0 indicates no correlation between occupancy and ADR\n",
      "\n",
      "This analysis can help identify properties where occupancy and ADR move together strongly (high positive correlation) versus properties where they may move in opposite directions (negative correlation).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. RevPAR Calculation:\n",
      "The database lacks the necessary room revenue and available room details at the property level to accurately calculate RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room). While the FINAL_INCOME_SHEET_NEW_SEQ table contains revenue information, it does not specify room revenue or available rooms. Without this granular data, calculating the true RevPAR metric is not possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Budgeted RevPAR Targets:\n",
      "The FINAL_BUDGET_SHEET table contains budgeted RevPAR targets for each property, with separate columns for each month and a total column. This data can be queried to retrieve the budgeted monthly and annual RevPAR goals for different properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Actual vs. Budgeted RevPAR Comparison:\n",
      "To compare actual RevPAR performance against budgeted targets, the query joins the FINAL_BUDGET_SHEET (budgeted data) and FINAL_INCOME_SHEET_NEW_SEQ (actual data) tables. It filters for the 'TOTAL REV PAR' account name and a specific month (January 2024 in the example). By comparing the Budget_January and Actual_January columns, you can assess if the actual RevPAR met, exceeded, or fell short of the budgeted target for that month and property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional Information Needed:\n",
      "- To calculate occupancy rates and ADRs, access to booking data (check-in/check-out dates, number of rooms booked, rates) and property details (number of available rooms) would be required.\n",
      "- To calculate true RevPAR, room revenue and available room data at the property level would be needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while the database contains some financial data and budgeted targets, it lacks the specific operational details required to accurately calculate key performance metrics like occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR at the property level. Enhancing the database schema or integrating additional data sources would be necessary to enable these analyses.\n",
