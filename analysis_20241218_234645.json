The stock has shown an overall upward trend over the past year, with the price increasing from around $170 in May 2023 to around $195 currently in December 2023.\n\n2. There have been some volatile periods with large daily price swings, both up and down. For example, in early August 2024, the stock price dropped from around $225 to below $200 in a few days on high volume. Another volatile period was in early June 2024 when the price dropped from around $220 to below $195.\n\n3. The stock has hit 52-week highs around $250 in mid-December 2024 and lows around $170 in late April/early May 2024. \n\n4. Trading volume tends to increase during periods of higher volatility, indicating higher investor interest and activity around larger price moves.\n\n5. The price range between the daily highs and lows has varied, with some days showing a very tight range and others a wider intraday range, especially on volatile days.\n\nOverall, while showing an uptrend over the past year, the stock has experienced periods of volatility with large price swings in both directions, likely driven by specific events/news impacting the company or broader market sentiment.`\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE ",
