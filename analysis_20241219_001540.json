Another volatile period was in early June 2024 when the price dropped from around $220 to below $195.\n\n3. The stock has hit 52-week highs around $250 in mid-December 2024 and lows around $170 in late April/early May 2024. \n\n4. Trading volume tends to increase during periods of higher volatility, indicating higher investor interest and activity around larger price moves.\n\n5. The price range between the daily highs and lows has varied, with some days showing a very tight range and others a wider intraday range, especially on volatile days.\n\nOverall, while showing an uptrend over the past year, the stock has experienced periods of volatility with large price swings in both directions, likely driven by specific events/news impacting the company or broader market sentiment.`\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE ",

Recommendations:\n   - Key levels to watch: Monitor the $170 support level and the $250 resistance level for potential buying or selling opportunities.\n   - Risk considerations: Investors should be aware of the stock's volatility and potential for large price swings, which can increase risk.\n   - Potential scenarios: If the stock breaks above the $250 resistance level, it could signal a continuation of the uptrend. Conversely, a break below the $170 support level could indicate a potential downtrend.\n\nIt's important to note that this analysis is based solely on the historical price trend and does not consider other fundamental factors such as revenue growth, profitability, debt levels, or competitive positioning.
