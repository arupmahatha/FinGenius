This is the error: Could not parse LLM output: `The query retrieves the date, open price, close price, daily return percentage, high price, low price, and trading volume for each trading day since the beginning of 2023. The results are ordered by date in descending order to show the most recent days first.\n\nSome key observations from the results:\n\n1. The data covers stock price movements from December 18, 2023 to December 16, 2024, providing over a year's worth of historical price data.\n\n2. The daily return percentage shows the stock's daily price change relative to the open price. Positive values indicate the stock closed higher, while negative values mean it closed lower than the open.\n\n3. The high and low prices give the intraday price range for each day.\n\n4. The volume column shows the total number of shares traded that day, indicating trading activity levels.\n\n5. There is volatility in the stock's price movements, with some days showing large positive or negative daily returns along with wider intraday ranges and higher volumes.\n\nThis type of historical price data can be used for technical analysis, backtesting trading strategies, identifying volatility patterns, and other quantitative analyses related to the stock's price performance over time.`\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE ",

  "expert_analysis": "Based on the provided information, there is not enough data to conduct a comprehensive analysis and provide insights on the stock's potential as an investment opportunity. The results only contain a query for historical price data, but no actual data or information about the company's financials, performance metrics, or competitive positioning.\n\nTo properly assess whether the stock is worth investing in, we would need additional data such as:\n\n1. Revenue and earnings growth trends over multiple years\n2. Profitability metrics (net income, operating margins, etc.)\n3. Debt levels and capital structure\n4. Cash flow generation and management efficiency ratios\n5. Valuation multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA, etc.) compared to peers\n6. Competitive landscape and market share\n7. Management quality and business strategy\n8. Potential growth drivers and risks\n\nWithout this crucial information, it is difficult to make an informed investment decision. The historical price data alone is useful for technical analysis and identifying patterns, but it does not provide insights into the company's fundamental strengths, weaknesses, and growth prospects.\n\nTo properly analyze the stock's investment potential, we would need to gather comprehensive financial data, conduct a thorough industry and competitive analysis, and assess the company's qualitative factors such as management, strategy, and growth opportunities. Only then can we make a well-informed decision on whether the stock is worth investing in or not.",
