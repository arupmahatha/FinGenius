The results will be grouped by property and month, with the most recent months first.\n\nEBITDA is calculated as revenue minus operating expenses (department expenses and undistributed expenses). EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue, handling cases where revenue is 0 to avoid divide by zero errors.\n\nThe output columns are:\n- SQL_Property: The property name \n- Month: The month the data is for\n- Revenue: Total monthly revenue\n- Operating_Expenses: Total monthly operating expenses \n- EBITDA: Monthly EBITDA calculated as revenue - operating expenses\n- EBITDA_Margin: Monthly EBITDA margin calculated as EBITDA / revenue\n\nThis allows analyzing the monthly EBITDA performance and profitability of these two properties over the recent year. Higher EBITDA and EBITDA margins indicate more profitable months."
