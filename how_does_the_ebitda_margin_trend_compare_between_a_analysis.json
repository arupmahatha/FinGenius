This is the error: Could not parse LLM output: `The query successfully calculated the monthly EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the AC Wailea and Surfrider Malibu properties over the available time period in the database.\n\nSome key observations from the results:\n\n- For AC Wailea, the EBITDA margin ranges from around -270% to +18% over the months shown. Many months have negative EBITDA due to expenses exceeding revenues.\n\n- For Surfrider Malibu, the EBITDA margin ranges from around -105% to -33%. All months shown have negative EBITDA.\n\n- The most recent months of data are October 2024 for both properties.\n\n- There are some very large negative EBITDA values, like -$3.6M for AC Wailea in June 2024, indicating very high expenses compared to revenues in certain months.\n\n- The results cover over 2 years of monthly data from mid-2021 through October 2024.\n\nOverall, this provides the requested monthly EBITDA and margin metrics for analyzing the financial performance of these two properties over an extended time period. The wide swings in EBITDA margin each month likely warrant further investigation into the key revenue and expense drivers.`\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE ",

Calculate the monthly EBITDA margin for AC Wailea and Surfrider Malibu properties over the past 12 months:\n\n```sql\nWITH cte AS (\n  SELECT \n    property_name,\n    DATE_TRUNC('month', date) AS month,\n    SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,\n    SUM(expenses) AS total_expenses\n  FROM \n    operating_metrics\n  WHERE\n    property_name IN ('AC Wailea', 'Surfrider Malibu')\n    AND date >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '12 months'\n  GROUP BY\n    property_name, DATE_TRUNC('month', date)\n)\nSELECT\n  month,\n  property_name,\n  ROUND(100.0 * (total_revenue - total_expenses) / total_revenue, 2) AS ebitda_margin\nFROM\n  cte\nORDER BY\n  property_name, month;\n```\n\n2. Compare the actual EBITDA margins with the budgeted figures:\n\n```sql\nWITH actual AS (\n  -- Subquery from step 1\n),\nbudget AS (\n  SELECT\n    property_name,\n    month,\n    budgeted_ebitda_margin\n  FROM\n    budget_metrics\n  WHERE\n    property_name IN ('AC Wailea', 'Surfrider Malibu')\n    AND month >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '12 months'\n)\nSELECT\n  a.month,\n  a.property_name,\n  a.ebitda_margin AS actual_margin,\n  b.budgeted_ebitda_margin,\n  a.ebitda_margin - b.budgeted_ebitda_margin AS variance\nFROM\n  actual a\n  JOIN budget b ON a.property_name = b.property_name AND a.month = b.month\nORDER BY\n  a.property_name, a.month;\n```\n\nThis will give you the actual vs. budgeted EBITDA margins for each property over the past 12 months, along with the variance.\n\n3. Analyze the key drivers behind significant variances (if any) by looking at revenue and expense line items:\n\n```sql\nWITH variance AS (\n  -- Subquery from step 2\n  SELECT * \n  FROM previous_query\n  WHERE ABS(variance) > 5 -- Filter for significant variances, e.g. > 5%\n)\nSELECT\n  v.month,\n  v.property_name,\n  r.revenue_type,\n  r.actual_revenue,\n  r.budgeted_revenue,\n  r.actual_revenue - r.budgeted_revenue AS rev_variance,\n  e.expense_type,\n  e.actual_expense,\n  e.budgeted_expense,\n  e.actual_expense - e.budgeted_expense AS exp_variance\nFROM\n  variance v\n  LEFT JOIN revenue_metrics r\n    ON v.property_name = r.property_name\n    AND v.month = r.month  \n  LEFT JOIN expense_metrics e\n    ON v.property_name = e.property_name\n    AND v.month = e.month\nORDER BY\n  v.property_name, v.month;\n```\n\nThis query will show you the revenue and expense line items that contributed significantly to the EBITDA margin variance for the months where there was a large deviation from the budget.\n\nBy combining the results from these queries, you should be able to analyze the EBITDA margin trends for the two properties, identify periods with significant variances from the budget, and understand the key drivers behind those variances.",
