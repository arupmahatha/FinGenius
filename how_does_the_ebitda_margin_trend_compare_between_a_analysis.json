  "expert_analysis": "Based on the provided information, there are a few key points that require clarification to perform a comprehensive analysis:\n\n1. Time Period: The query for actual EBITDA margin returned null values for October 2024, likely because there is no data in the FINAL_INCOME_SHEET_NEW_SEQ table for that period. To analyze the trend over the past 12 months, I need to know the specific month and year for which data is available in the table.\n\n2. Budgeted Figures: The FINAL_BUDGET_SHEET table seems to contain annual budgeted figures rather than monthly. To compare actual EBITDA margins with budgeted figures, I need to know if you require a comparison against the annual budgeted EBITDA or if you need me to calculate the budgeted monthly EBITDA first by prorating the annual figures based on an allocation factor like occupancy or revenue per available room (RevPAR).\n\n3. Revenue and Expense Line Items: To analyze the key drivers behind significant variances in EBITDA margins, I would need access to the revenue and expense line item data from the relevant tables. The provided information does not include this data.\n\nOnce these clarifications are provided, I can modify the queries accordingly and perform the following analysis:\n\n1. Calculate the monthly EBITDA margin for AC Wailea and Surfrider Malibu properties over the past 12 months (or the specified time period).\n\n2. Compare the actual EBITDA margins with the budgeted figures (monthly or annual, as per the clarification) for both properties.\n\n3. Identify any significant variances between actual and budgeted EBITDA margins for each property.\n\n4. Analyze the revenue and expense line items to understand the key drivers behind the significant variances in EBITDA margins.\n\n5. Provide insights into the trends, patterns, and potential reasons for the variances, considering factors such as occupancy rates, average daily rates (ADRs), operating expenses, and any other relevant factors that can be derived from the data.\n\nBy addressing these clarifications, I can provide a more comprehensive and data-driven analysis of the EBITDA margin trends, variances from budgeted figures, and the underlying drivers for the AC Wailea and Surfrider Malibu properties.",

Calculating EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue\n\nThe key steps are:\n\nWITH revenue AS (...) -- Calculate total revenue \nexpenses AS (...) -- Calculate total expenses\n\nSELECT\n  r.total_revenue,\n  e.operating_expenses + e.dept_expenses + e.undistributed_expenses AS total_expenses,\n  r.total_revenue - (e.operating_expenses + e.dept_expenses + e.undistributed_expenses) AS ebitda,\n  ROUND(1.0 * ebitda / r.total_revenue, 2) AS ebitda_margin\nFROM revenue r\nJOIN expenses e\n  ON r.SQL_Property = e.SQL_Property \n  AND r.Month = e.Month\n\nThis should provide the monthly EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the specified properties and time period based on the data in the FINAL_INCOME_SHEET_NEW_SEQ table."

Compare the actual EBITDA margins with the budgeted figures:\n\n```sql\nWITH actual AS (\n  -- Subquery from step 1\n),\nbudget AS (\n  SELECT\n    property_name,\n    month,\n    budgeted_ebitda_margin\n  FROM\n    budget_metrics\n  WHERE\n    property_name IN ('AC Wailea', 'Surfrider Malibu')\n    AND month >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '12 months'\n)\nSELECT\n  a.month,\n  a.property_name,\n  a.ebitda_margin AS actual_margin,\n  b.budgeted_ebitda_margin,\n  a.ebitda_margin - b.budgeted_ebitda_margin AS variance\nFROM\n  actual a\n  JOIN budget b ON a.property_name = b.property_name AND a.month = b.month\nORDER BY\n  a.property_name, a.month;\n```\n\nThis will give you the actual vs. budgeted EBITDA margins for each property over the past 12 months, along with the variance.\n\n3. Analyze the key drivers behind significant variances (if any) by looking at revenue and expense line items:\n\n```sql\nWITH variance AS (\n  -- Subquery from step 2\n  SELECT * \n  FROM previous_query\n  WHERE ABS(variance) > 5 -- Filter for significant variances, e.g. > 5%\n)\nSELECT\n  v.month,\n  v.property_name,\n  r.revenue_type,\n  r.actual_revenue,\n  r.budgeted_revenue,\n  r.actual_revenue - r.budgeted_revenue AS rev_variance,\n  e.expense_type,\n  e.actual_expense,\n  e.budgeted_expense,\n  e.actual_expense - e.budgeted_expense AS exp_variance\nFROM\n  variance v\n  LEFT JOIN revenue_metrics r\n    ON v.property_name = r.property_name\n    AND v.month = r.month  \n  LEFT JOIN expense_metrics e\n    ON v.property_name = e.property_name\n    AND v.month = e.month\nORDER BY\n  v.property_name, v.month;\n```\n\nThis query will show you the revenue and expense line items that contributed significantly to the EBITDA margin variance for the months where there was a large deviation from the budget.\n\nBy combining the results from these queries, you should be able to analyze the EBITDA margin trends for the two properties, identify periods with significant variances from the budget, and understand the key drivers behind those variances.",
