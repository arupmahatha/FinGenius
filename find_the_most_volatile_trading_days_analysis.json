  "expert_analysis": "Based on the provided SQL results, here is a comprehensive analysis:\n\n1. Key Findings\n   - Main price trends:\n     - The query identifies the most volatile trading days based on the daily price range (difference between high and low prices) and trading volume compared to averages.\n     - Days with larger price ranges and higher trading volumes indicate increased volatility and activity.\n\n   - Volume patterns:\n     - The query calculates the volume ratio, which compares the daily trading volume to the average volume.\n     - Higher volume ratios suggest abnormally high trading activity, potentially driven by significant events or news.\n\n   - Notable events:\n     - The top results likely represent days with major market-moving events, news, or catalysts that led to increased volatility and trading activity.\n     - Further analysis would be required to pinpoint the specific events or factors behind the most volatile days.\n\n2. Technical Analysis\n   - Support/resistance levels:\n     - The daily price ranges can provide insights into potential support and resistance levels.\n     - The low of the range may act as support, while the high could indicate resistance levels for that trading session.\n\n   - Pattern recognition:\n     - Analyzing the price action and volume patterns around the most volatile days could reveal technical patterns, such as breakouts, reversals, or consolidation periods.\n\n   - Momentum indicators:\n     - Combining the price range and volume data with momentum indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) could help identify potential overbought or oversold conditions during volatile periods.\n\n3. Risk Assessment\n   - Volatility measures:\n     - The daily price range percentage provides a quantitative measure of volatility, allowing for comparisons across different trading days.\n     - Higher price range percentages indicate increased volatility and potential risk.\n\n   - Liquidity analysis:\n     - The trading volume data can be used to assess liquidity conditions during volatile periods.\n     - Low liquidity (low volume) during high volatility can amplify risks and make it challenging to execute trades.\n\n   - Risk factors:\n     - Volatile trading days may be associated with increased risks, such as wider bid-ask spreads, potential for slippage, and higher chances of gap openings or closings.\n     - Traders should exercise caution and implement appropriate risk management strategies during periods of heightened volatility.\n\n4. Recommendations\n   - Key levels to watch:\n     - Monitor the high and low prices from the most volatile days, as these levels may act as potential support and resistance areas in the future.\n     - Pay close attention to price action and volume around these key levels for potential trading opportunities or risk management.\n\n   - Risk considerations:\n     - Implement appropriate risk management strategies, such as using stop-loss orders, position sizing, and diversification, when trading during volatile periods.\n     - Consider adjusting position sizes or avoiding trading altogether during periods of extreme volatility if the risk is deemed too high.\n\n   - Potential scenarios:\n     - If volatility persists, traders may consider strategies like range trading, scalping, or intraday swing trading to capitalize on the price movements.\n     - If volatility subsides, traders may shift focus to longer-term trends, support/resistance levels, and other technical indicators for potential trading opportunities.\n\nOverall, the provided SQL results highlight the most volatile trading days based on price ranges and trading volumes, allowing traders to identify periods of increased risk and potential opportunities.
