  "expert_analysis": "Based on the provided SQL results, here is a comprehensive analysis:\n\n1. Key Findings\n   - Main price trends:\n     - The query identifies the most volatile trading days by looking at days with large intraday price ranges (difference between high and low prices) and high trading volumes compared to average levels.\n     - The top results show days with price ranges from around 4% up to nearly 9%, indicating significant intraday price swings.\n     - These volatile days also had trading volumes that were multiples higher than the average volume.\n\n   - Volume patterns:\n     - The analysis incorporates trading volume as a key factor, looking for days where volume exceeded 2 times the average level.\n     - High volume tends to accompany volatile price movements, as increased participation and trading activity can exacerbate price swings.\n\n   - Notable events:\n     - Days with this combination of large price ranges and elevated volumes likely coincided with major market events, news releases, or other catalysts that drove higher volatility.\n     - Without additional context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact events, but these volatile sessions represent potential trading opportunities as well as higher risk periods.\n\n2. Technical Analysis\n   - Support/resistance levels: The analysis does not provide specific support or resistance levels, but the daily price ranges give an indication of the intraday volatility range on those sessions.\n   - Pattern recognition: No clear technical patterns are identified, but large price ranges and volume spikes can sometimes precede the formation of patterns like gaps or volatile consolidations.\n   - Momentum indicators: The raw output does not include any momentum indicators, but the combination of large price ranges and volume could be used as a basic measure of volatility momentum.\n\n3. Risk Assessment\n   - Volatility measures: The primary volatility measure used is the daily price range percentage, calculated as (High - Low) / Open * 100. This quantifies the intraday price swing relative to the opening price.\n   - Liquidity analysis: Trading volume is incorporated as a liquidity measure, with the analysis focusing on days with volumes over 2 times the average level.\n   - Risk factors: Large price ranges and high volumes indicate higher volatility risk. Traders need to be aware of potential slippage and manage position sizes accordingly on these volatile days.\n\n4. Recommendations\n   - Key levels to watch: For the identified volatile sessions, traders should monitor the daily price range for potential support/resistance or entry/exit levels.\n   - Risk considerations: These volatile days carry higher risk, so traders should employ appropriate risk management techniques like stop losses and position sizing.\n   - Potential scenarios: Volatile days could lead to continuation of the trend, range expansions, or reversals. Traders should prepare for different scenarios and have a trading plan.\n\nOverall, the analysis identifies trading days with abnormally large intraday price ranges and volumes, which are characteristics of highly volatile market conditions. While presenting opportunities, these sessions also carry higher risk that requires proper risk management practices.",

    "decomposition": "To find the most volatile trading days, we can analyze the daily price range (the difference between the highest and lowest price) for each trading day. The days with the largest price ranges can be considered the most volatile. Here's an SQL query that can help you find the most volatile trading days:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    trade_date,\n    MAX(high_price) - MIN(low_price) AS daily_price_range\nFROM\n    stock_prices\nGROUP BY\n    trade_date\nORDER BY\n    daily_price_range DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis query performs the following steps:\n\n1. It selects the `trade_date` and calculates the daily price range by taking the difference between the maximum `high_price` and the minimum `low_price` for each day.\n2. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the data by `trade_date` to calculate the daily price range.\n3. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the `daily_price_range` in descending order, putting the days with the largest price ranges at the top.\n4. The `LIMIT 10` clause limits the output to the top 10 most volatile trading days.\n\nNote that you'll need to replace `stock_prices` with the actual name of your table containing the stock price data, and `high_price`, `low_price`, and `trade_date` with the corresponding column names in your table.\n\nThis query assumes that you have a table with columns for the trade date, high price, and low price of the stock. If your data is structured differently, you may need to modify the query accordingly.",
