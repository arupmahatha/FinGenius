However, I can analyze the recent trends for this company based on the available metrics:\n\n- The stock has seen positive daily returns recently, with returns ranging from around 0.1% to 2% over the last 10 trading days shown. This indicates the stock price has been increasing.\n\n- The daily price ranges have been relatively wide, around 1-2% on average. This suggests higher volatility and larger intraday price swings.\n\n- Trading volume has been fairly high, exceeding 30 million shares on most of the recent days. Higher volume can signal increased interest and activity in the stock.\n\nOverall, the data points to an upward price trend accompanied by elevated volatility and trading activity for this stock over the past 10 days. However, without comparative data on peers or the broader market, it's difficult to assess whether this company is outperforming or underperforming its sector or competitors. The analysis is limited to just examining the recent isolated stock dynamics for this single company."

  "expert_analysis": "Based on the provided SQL results and information, here is a comprehensive analysis:\n\n1. Key Findings:\n   - Main price trends: The stock has exhibited an upward price trend recently, with positive daily returns ranging from 0.1% to 2% over the last 10 trading days. However, the data only covers a limited time period, so it's difficult to assess long-term trends.\n   - Volume patterns: Trading volume has been relatively high, exceeding 30 million shares on most recent days, indicating increased interest and activity in the stock.\n   - Notable events: The data does not provide any information about specific events or news that may have impacted the stock's performance.\n\n2. Technical Analysis:\n   - Support/resistance levels: The data does not provide enough historical information to identify reliable support or resistance levels.\n   - Pattern recognition: No clear technical patterns can be identified from the limited data provided.\n   - Momentum indicators: The positive daily returns and high trading volume suggest positive momentum in the short term.\n\n3. Risk Assessment:\n   - Volatility measures: The wide daily price ranges (1-2% on average) indicate higher volatility and larger intraday price swings.\n   - Liquidity analysis: The high trading volume suggests good liquidity for the stock.\n   - Risk factors: Without additional financial data, it's difficult to assess potential risk factors such as the company's profitability, debt levels, or competitive positioning.\n\n4. Recommendations:\n   - Key levels to watch: Due to the limited data, it's challenging to identify specific price levels to monitor.\n   - Risk considerations: The higher volatility and lack of financial information suggest potential risks that should be carefully evaluated before investing.\n   - Potential scenarios: With only a short-term upward trend and limited data, it's difficult to predict potential scenarios or make informed investment decisions.\n\nOverall, the analysis is limited by the lack of comprehensive financial data and historical price information. While the recent upward price trend and high trading volume are positive signals, the absence of key metrics like revenue growth, profitability, debt levels, and valuation comparisons to peers makes it challenging to provide a thorough assessment of the stock's investment potential. Additional data and analysis would be required to make an informed investment decision.",

Here are some sub-questions and potential SQL queries that could help analyze the stock:\n\n1.

How profitable is the company?\n```sql\nSELECT fiscal_year, net_income, net_income/revenue AS profit_margin\nFROM financial_reports\nWHERE company_id = <company_id>\nORDER BY fiscal_year;\n```\n\n3. What is the company's debt level?\n```sql\nSELECT fiscal_year, total_debt, total_debt/total_assets AS debt_ratio\nFROM financial_reports\nWHERE company_id = <company_id>\nORDER BY fiscal_year;\n```\n\n4.
